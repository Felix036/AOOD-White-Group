# AOOD-White-Group
ToDo List Proposal

## How to use Github Desktop with Eclipse
### Getting Started
- Install Github Desktop at https://desktop.github.com/ 
- Fork the repository in your browser
- Go to https://github.com/adit-bala/AOOD-White-Group
- Click Fork in the top right
- Click your account
- Leave the tab open
### Create a new Java Project in Eclipse
- File > New > Java Project
- Name it ToDoList
- Click Finish
### Clone the forked repository into your project
- Go back to your forked repository in Github and click Code
- Click Open with GitHub Desktop
- On the local path field click Choose…
- Navigate to where the Java Project you just made is stored (if you don’t know, in Eclipse do File > Switch Workspace > Other… and look at the workspace field)
- Click Select Folder
- Click clone
### Reformat your Java Project
- Go back to Eclipse
- Right click on your project and click refresh
- Delete the src folder
- Right click AOOD-White-Group, click refactor, and rename to src
- Right click src > Build Path > Use as Source Folder
### Fix Github Desktop stuff
- Go back to Github Desktop which probably says “Can’t find AOOD White Group”
- Click locate and click the new src folder
### Done setting up
